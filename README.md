# Atomium

> ðŸš§ Atomium is a proof-of-concept project for a design system ðŸš§

It is built using a variety of powerful technologies, including:

- **NX**: a set of extensible dev tools for monorepos, which helps us build and manage multiple projects within a single repository.
- **Stencil**: a web component compiler that generates standard-compliant components using TypeScript, JSX, and HTML.
- **Ionic**: a set of UI components and tools that help developers build performant, high-quality mobile and desktop applications using web technologies.
- **Storybook**: a user interface development environment and testing tool that allows us to create and showcase components in isolation.
- **Typescript**: a typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript, providing powerful tools for building large-scale applications.
- **Web Components**: a set of standards that enable the creation of reusable, encapsulated components using open web technologies.

This project is a work in progress, and as such, is not yet ready for production use. We're using it to experiment with and develop our design system, so watch this space for updates!
