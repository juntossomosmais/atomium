# ADR 0012: Carousel with Swipe

üóìÔ∏è 2023-08 ¬∑ ‚úçÔ∏è [@schirrel](https://github.com/schirrel), [@MayaraRMA](https://github.com/MayaraRMA), [@tassioFront](https://github.com/tassioFront) and [@felipefialho](https://twitter.com/felipefialho_)

## Context

We need a Carousel component with consistent layout across projects.

## Decision Drivers

- We need a Carousel component/library must be web component;
- The Carousel component/library must give us the possibility to adjust styles as we need to match our Style Guide;
- The Carousel component/library should have a good integrations with Ionic components, once it is the source of our Design System.


## Considered Options
As we already have the usage of the [Swiper](https://swiperjs.com/) with an ond version inside an project and Ionic itself [indicates the migration](https://ionicframework.com/docs/v6/api/slides#migration) of the same once they have discontinued the ion-slides.
The [Swiper](https://swiperjs.com/)  was the only option considered. 


## Decision
We have decided to use Swiper as our Carousel component library, once it match our requirements and we have a previous knowledge, doing a internal wrapper to maintain the Atomium signature.
