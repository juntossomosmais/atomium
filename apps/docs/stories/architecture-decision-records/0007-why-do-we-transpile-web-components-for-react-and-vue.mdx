# ADR 0007: Why do we transpile Web Components for React and Vue?

üóìÔ∏è ~2023-04~ 2024-05 ¬∑ ‚úçÔ∏è [@felipefialho](https://twitter.com/felipefialho_)

## Context

We need to use Web Components in our projects built with Vue and React (Next.js) while maintaining a good Developer Experience (DX).

## Problems

### React

* We need to use `Event Listeners` to handle events and methods when using Web Components
* React [use `SyntheticEvent` to handle events](https://legacy.reactjs.org/docs/events.html), and we need to convert it to `CustomEvent` to use Web Components
* Props that use `array` or `object` need to be converted to JSON for compatibility
* We need to use `ref` to access the Web Component API in React
* Sometimes, we need to create wrappers to effectively use Web Components in React
* Overall, the Developer Experience in React is not optimal when working with Web Components

### Vue

* Props that use `array` or `object` need to be converted to JSON for compatibility
* We need to use `ref` to access the Web Component API in Vue
* We need to create wrappers to effectively use Web Components in Vue and it is not always straightforward

## Decision

\~To address these challenges, we have decided to use Stencil to create a transpiled version of Web Components specifically for React, while keeping the original version for Vue.~

\~Currently, we are using Vue 2 (as of April 2022), and the transpiler of Stencil is not compatible with Vue 2, however, Vue provides a good DX and seamless compatibility with Web Components.~

\~In the future, when we migrate to Vue 3, we may reevaluate this decision and consider transpiling Web Components for Vue as well.~

### Update

Now we are using Vue 3, and we have decided to transpile Web Components for both React and Vue to provide a better Developer Experience (DX) and to ensure compatibility with the latest versions of both libraries.
