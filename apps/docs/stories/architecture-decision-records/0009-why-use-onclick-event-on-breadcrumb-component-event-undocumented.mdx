# Why use `onClick` event on breadcrumb component even undocumented?

🗓️ 2023-07 · ✍️ [@denilsonrp](https://github.com/denilsonrp)

## Context

In the [breadcrumb component's pull request](https://github.com/juntossomosmais/atomium/pull/163) a [doubt arose about the correct functioning of the `onClick` event](https://github.com/juntossomosmais/atomium/pull/163#discussion_r1250986555), as this event isn't documented in [ion-breadcrumb docs](https://ionicframework.com/docs/api/breadcrumb#events).

## Decision

We ran some tests on Atomium's breadcrumb component in order to ensure the correct firing of the event and even though the `onClick` event isn't documented in the events section of the [ion-breadcrumb docs](https://ionicframework.com/docs/api/breadcrumb#events), the tests were successful and the event fired correctly.

Based on these tests, we can assume that, even without event documentation, it's possible to use it. The idea of ​​exposing this decision is to serve as a reference in possible similar scenarios in the future.
