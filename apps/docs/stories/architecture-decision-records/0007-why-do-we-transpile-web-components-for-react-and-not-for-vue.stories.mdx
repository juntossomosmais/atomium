# ADR 0007: Why do we transpile Web Components for React and not for Vue?

üóìÔ∏è 2023-04 ¬∑ ‚úçÔ∏è [@felipefialho](https://twitter.com/felipefialho_)

## Context

We need to use Web Components in our projects built with Vue and React (Next.js) while maintaining a good Developer Experience (DX).

## Problems

### React

- We need to use `Event Listeners` to handle events and methods when using Web Components
- React use `SyntheticEvent` to handle events, and we need to convert it to `CustomEvent` to use Web Components
- Props that use `array` or `object` need to be converted to JSON for compatibility
- We need to use `ref` to access the Web Component API in React
- Sometimes, we need to create wrappers to effectively use Web Components in React
- Overall, the Developer Experience in React is not optimal when working with Web Components

### Vue

- Props that use `array` or `object` need to be converted to JSON for compatibility

## Decision

To address these challenges, we have decided to use Stencil to create a transpiled version of Web Components specifically for React, while keeping the original version for Vue.

Currently, we are using Vue 2 (as of April 2022), and the transpiler of Stencil is not compatible with Vue 2, however, Vue provides a good DX and seamless compatibility with Web Components.

In the future, when we migrate to Vue 3, we may reevaluate this decision and consider transpiling Web Components for Vue as well.
