# ADR 0010: Why do we need a fix in React?

🗓️ 2023-07 · ✍️ [@igorwessel](https://twitter.com/igor_wessel)

## Context

In order to achieve a better DX with boolean props in React.

## Problems

Today (07/19/2023) the Stencil does not follow the HTML spec for boolean props, which caused problems in testing/styling because expected to not have a attribute in HTML when is false.

Example:

```jsx

<AtomButton disabled={false} />

// output in html

<atom-button disabled="false" />
```

So it affects styles, and tests where the boolean attribute shouldn't exist

Examples:

```css
// regardless if disabled is false/true will still be applied.
atom-button[disabled] {
  background-color: red;
}
```

```js
// regardless if disabled is false/true will throw a false-positive because expects the attribute does not exist.
expect(atom - button).toBeDisabled()
```

## Decision

After we consider the options:

* Living with the problem for possibly in the near future react will offer better [support](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/11347) for web-components.
  > We can see [tests in a experimental branch here](https://custom-elements-everywhere.com/libraries/react-experimental/results/results.html)
* We are already transpiling the web-component to React, could use a workaround.

Based on these options, we decide to use workaround which will basically set/remove attributes after [occurs a update in component.](https://react.dev/reference/react/Component#componentdidupdate)
