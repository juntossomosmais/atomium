# About Vue Components

All [Vue Components is generated by Stencil](https://stenciljs.com/docs/vue) using [Stencil's output target](https://stenciljs.com/docs/vue#output-targets) to automatically generate Vue components from our Atomium's web components.

The target of this stories is run Atomium's web components in Vue environment and show how to use the components.

**!important**

There is a problem to render the code of [Vue's components outputed by Stencil in Storybook](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/issues/22287), so the code of the components is not shown correctly in the stories.

Example, in [Button component](?path=/docs/react_components-button--docs):

```jsx
{
  render: args => createButton(args),
  args: {
    ...ButtonComponentArgs
  }
}
```

The code above is not shown correctly in the stories, but it is correct in the source code:

```jsx
<AtomButton color='primary' fill='solid' mode='md' shape='round' type='button'>
  Button
</AtomButton>
```

Just keep in mind that when check the code of the components inside Storybook
