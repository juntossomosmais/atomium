# About React Components

All [React Components is generated by Stencil](https://stenciljs.com/docs/react) using [Stencil's output target](https://stenciljs.com/docs/react#output-targets) to automatically generate React components from our Atomium's web components.

The target of this stories is run Atomium's web components in React environment and show how to use the components.

**!important**

There is a problem to render the code of [React's components outputed by Stencil in Storybook](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/issues/8881), so the code of the components is not shown correctly in the stories.

Example, in [Button component](?path=/docs/react_components-button--docs):

```jsx
<forwardRef color="primary" fill="solid" mode="md" shape="round" type="button">
  Button
</forwardRef>
```

The code above is not shown correctly in the stories, but it is correct in the source code:

```jsx
<AtomButton color="primary" fill="solid" mode="md" shape="round" type="button">
  Button
</AtomButton>
```

Just keep in mind that when check the code of the components inside Storybook
