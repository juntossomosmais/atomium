/**
 * This configuration is intended to be applied to ALL .js and .jsx files

 *
 * It should therefore NOT contain any rules or plugins which are specific
 * to one ecosystem, such as React, Angular, Node etc.
 *
 * We use @typescript-eslint/parser rather than the built in JS parser
 * because that is what Nx ESLint configs have always done and we don't
 * want to change too much all at once.
 *
 * TODO: Evaluate switching to the built-in JS parser (espree) in Nx v11,
 * it should yield a performance improvement but could introduce subtle
 * breaking changes - we should also look to replace all the @typescript-eslint
 * related plugins and rules below.
