/**
 * The purpose of this migrator is to help users move away
 * from the root .storybook/ configuration folder and files.
 *
 * Since we cannot be sure of how users make use of the root Storybook
 * directory, what we are going to do is the following:
 *
 * 1. Make sure that all project-level .storybook/main.js files contain
 * the @storybook/addon-essentials addon.
 * 2. If the root .storybook/main.js file contains the @storybook/addon-essentials remove it
 * from the root
 * 3. If there are things beyond the addons array in the root .storybook/main.js file,
 * then keep it as it is - inform user that they need to manually need to copy over any extra stuff
 * 4. If the root .storybook/main.js file is now empty, inform user that they can delete it safely
 *
 * Point the user to a guide that explains how to all these things.
