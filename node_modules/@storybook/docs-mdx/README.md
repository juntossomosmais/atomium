## @storybook/docs-mdx

Storybook MDX docs is a small library that analyzes the contents of a `.docs.mdx` file and produces metadata about its contents.

This is an internal library, used to help generate the Storybook's `index.json`, the static index of all the contents of your storybook.

It currently produces:

| name    | example                            | description                             |
| ------- | ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| title   | `<Meta title="x">`                 | A manually specified title              |
| of      | `<Meta of={buttonMeta}>`           | A title specified by an imported object |
| imports | `import * from './Button.stories'` | The list of ESM imports                 |
