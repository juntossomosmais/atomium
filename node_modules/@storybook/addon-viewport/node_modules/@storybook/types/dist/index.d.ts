Sometimes it is desired to pass a value as a function argument that has a different type. At first inspection it may seem assignable, and then you discover it is not because the `value`'s type definition was defined as an interface. In the following example, `fn` requires an argument of type `Record<string, unknown>`. If the value is defined as a literal, then it is assignable. And if the `value` is defined as type using the `Simplify` utility the value is assignable.  But if the `value` is defined as an interface, it is not assignable because the interface is not sealed and elsewhere a non-string property could be added to the interface.

If the type definition must be an interface (perhaps it was defined in a third-party npm package), then the `value` can be defined as `const value: Simplify<SomeInterface> = ...`. Then `value` will be assignable to the `fn` argument.  Or the `value` can be cast as `Simplify<SomeInterface>` if you can't re-declare the `value`.

@example
```
import type {Simplify} from 'type-fest';

interface SomeInterface {
	foo: number;
	bar?: string;
	baz: number | undefined;
}

type SomeType = {
	foo: number;
	bar?: string;
	baz: number | undefined;
};

const literal = {foo: 123, bar: 'hello', baz: 456};
const someType: SomeType = literal;
const someInterface: SomeInterface = literal;

function fn(object: Record<string, unknown>): void {}

fn(literal); // Good: literal object type is sealed
fn(someType); // Good: type is sealed
fn(someInterface); // Error: Index signature for type 'string' is missing in type 'someInterface'. Because `interface` can be re-opened
fn(someInterface as Simplify<SomeInterface>); // Good: transform an `interface` into a `type`
```

/**
Remove any index signatures from the given object type, so that only explicitly defined properties remain.

Use-cases:
- Remove overly permissive signatures from third-party types.

This type was taken from this [StackOverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/68261113/420747).

It relies on the fact that an empty object (`{}`) is assignable to an object with just an index signature, like `Record<string, unknown>`, but not to an object with explicitly defined keys, like `Record<'foo' | 'bar', unknown>`.

(The actual value type, `unknown`, is irrelevant and could be any type. Only the key type matters.)

```
const indexed: Record<string, unknown> = {}; // Allowed

const keyed: Record<'foo', unknown> = {}; // Error
// => TS2739: Type '{}' is missing the following properties from type 'Record<"foo" | "bar", unknown>': foo, bar
```

Instead of causing a type error like the above, you can also use a [conditional type](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/conditional-types.html) to test whether a type is assignable to another:

```
type Indexed = {} extends Record<string, unknown>
	? '✅ `{}` is assignable to `Record<string, unknown>`'
	: '❌ `{}` is NOT assignable to `Record<string, unknown>`';
// => '✅ `{}` is assignable to `Record<string, unknown>`'

type Keyed = {} extends Record<'foo' | 'bar', unknown>
	? "✅ `{}` is assignable to `Record<'foo' | 'bar', unknown>`"
	: "❌ `{}` is NOT assignable to `Record<'foo' | 'bar', unknown>`";
// => "❌ `{}` is NOT assignable to `Record<'foo' | 'bar', unknown>`"
```

Using a [mapped type](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/mapped-types.html#further-exploration), you can then check for each `KeyType` of `ObjectType`...

```
import type {RemoveIndexSignature} from 'type-fest';

type RemoveIndexSignature<ObjectType> = {
	[KeyType in keyof ObjectType // Map each key of `ObjectType`...
	]: ObjectType[KeyType]; // ...to its original value, i.e. `RemoveIndexSignature<Foo> == Foo`.
};
```

...whether an empty object (`{}`) would be assignable to an object with that `KeyType` (`Record<KeyType, unknown>`)...

```
import type {RemoveIndexSignature} from 'type-fest';

type RemoveIndexSignature<ObjectType> = {
	[KeyType in keyof ObjectType
		// Is `{}` assignable to `Record<KeyType, unknown>`?
		as {} extends Record<KeyType, unknown>
			? ... // ✅ `{}` is assignable to `Record<KeyType, unknown>`
			: ... // ❌ `{}` is NOT assignable to `Record<KeyType, unknown>`
	]: ObjectType[KeyType];
};
```

If `{}` is assignable, it means that `KeyType` is an index signature and we want to remove it. If it is not assignable, `KeyType` is a "real" key and we want to keep it.

```
import type {RemoveIndexSignature} from 'type-fest';

type RemoveIndexSignature<ObjectType> = {
	[KeyType in keyof ObjectType
		as {} extends Record<KeyType, unknown>
			? never // => Remove this `KeyType`.
			: KeyType // => Keep this `KeyType` as it is.
	]: ObjectType[KeyType];
};
```

@example
```
import type {RemoveIndexSignature} from 'type-fest';

interface Example {
	// These index signatures will be removed.
	[x: string]: any
	[x: number]: any
	[x: symbol]: any
	[x: `head-${string}`]: string
	[x: `${string}-tail`]: string
	[x: `head-${string}-tail`]: string
	[x: `${bigint}`]: string
	[x: `embedded-${number}`]: string

	// These explicitly defined keys will remain.
	foo: 'bar';
	qux?: 'baz';
}

type ExampleWithoutIndexSignatures = RemoveIndexSignature<Example>;
// => { foo: 'bar'; qux?: 'baz' | undefined; }

/**
Allows creating a union type by combining primitive types and literal types without sacrificing auto-completion in IDEs for the literal type part of the union.

Currently, when a union type of a primitive type is combined with literal types, TypeScript loses all information about the combined literals. Thus, when such type is used in an IDE with autocompletion, no suggestions are made for the declared literals.

This type is a workaround for [Microsoft/TypeScript#29729](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/issues/29729). It will be removed as soon as it's not needed anymore.

@example
```
import type {LiteralUnion} from 'type-fest';

// Before

type Pet = 'dog' | 'cat' | string;

const pet: Pet = '';
// Start typing in your TypeScript-enabled IDE.
// You **will not** get auto-completion for `dog` and `cat` literals.

// After

type Pet2 = LiteralUnion<'dog' | 'cat', string>;

const pet: Pet2 = '';
// You **will** get auto-completion for `dog` and `cat` literals.
```
