## @storybook/addon-mdx-gfm

The "@storybook/addon-mdx-gfm" addon is meant as a migration assistant for Storybook 7.0, providing Github Flavored Markdown support to Storybook docs.

> Note:
> This addon will likely be removed in a future version.

It's recommended you read this document and follow its instructions instead:
https://storybook.js.org/docs/7.0/react/writing-docs/mdx#lack-of-github-flavored-markdown-gfm

Once you've made the necessary changes, you can remove the addon from your package.json and storybook config.
