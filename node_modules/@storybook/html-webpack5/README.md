# Storybook for HTML

---

Storybook for HTML is a UI development environment for your plain HTML snippets.
With it, you can visualize different states of your UI components and develop them interactively.

Storybook runs outside of your app.
So you can develop UI components in isolation without worrying about app specific dependencies and requirements.

## Getting Started

```sh
cd my-app
npx storybook init -t html
```

For more information visit: [storybook.js.org](https://storybook.js.org)

### Typescript

`npx sb init` will select `.ts` starter stories if your `package.json` has typescript as a dependency. If starting a new project,
run `npm init` and `npm install typescript --save-dev` before initializing storybook to get the typescript starter stories.

Storybook also comes with a lot of [addons](https://storybook.js.org/addons) and a great API to customize as you wish.
You can also build a [static version](https://storybook.js.org/docs/html/sharing/publish-storybook) of your Storybook and deploy it anywhere you want.
