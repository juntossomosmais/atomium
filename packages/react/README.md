# Atomium - React

This is the React transpiled implementation of the Atomium design system to be used in React projects.

The React wrappers are automatically generated by Stencil using the `@stencil/react-output-target`, providing a seamless integration between Web Components and React with proper TypeScript support, event handling, and prop passing.

## Getting Started

### Installation

```bash
npm i @juntossomosmais/atomium
```

**Note:** The `@stencil/react-output-target` runtime is automatically installed as a dependency. You don't need to install it explicitly.

### Basic Usage

```jsx
import '@juntossomosmais/atomium/core.css'

import { AtomButton } from '@juntossomosmais/atomium/react'

<AtomButton>Click me</AtomButton>
```

### How It Works

The React components are generated wrappers around the core Web Components. Each component:
- Uses `@stencil/react-output-target/runtime` for component creation and event handling
- Provides proper TypeScript types and interfaces
- Handles React synthetic events correctly
- Manages props, refs, and lifecycle methods seamlessly

### Available Components

All Atomium custom components (prefixed with `atom-`) are available as React wrappers. Ionic components are imported globally and can be used directly from `@ionic/core` if needed.
